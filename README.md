For quite some time, I have been meaning to have a blog of my own to just have my thoughts and opinions out there. 
I even started one with one of my friends and we uploaded some posts - however, the "why" of the posts wasn't defined and that was about it. (An older version of a blog is still hosted on unpaid wordpress site - https://scintillalive.wordpress.com/ )

I have come across blogs where the authors have shared their incomplete work - this idea of sharing unpolished and yet to be completed thoughts has spoken to me many times. There are so many worthy topics of conversation which I don't have a final verdict on but have thought about for quite some time. 

This blog is an attempt to write and share my thoughts on topics that I feel concerned about but my comments might or might not be polished yet.
Looking forward to spark conversations and add food to my thoughts.

Please feel free to connect with me.
