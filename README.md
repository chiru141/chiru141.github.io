For quite some time, I have been meaning to have a blog of my own to just have my thoughts and opinions out there. 
I even started one with one of my friends and we uploaded some posts - however, the "why" of the posts wasn't defined and that was about it. (An older version of a blog is still hosted on unpaid WordPress site - https://scintillalive.wordpress.com/ )

I have come across blogs where the authors have shared their incomplete work - this idea of sharing unpolished and yet-to-be-completed thoughts has spoken to me many times. There are so many worthy topics of conversation that I don't have a final verdict on but have thought about for quite some time. 

This blog is an attempt to write and share my thoughts on topics that I feel concerned about but my comments might or might not be polished yet.
Looking forward to sparking conversations and adding food to my thoughts. I would appreciate it if you reach out to me in response to any of the articles/content.
