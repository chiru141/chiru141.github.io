I started working at Accenture Strategy in mid-september, around 4 months back. And my time here has been a mix of being at peace that I am here, being excited what this place has in store for me - in terms of learning, professional development, growth (and money) and at times - with the question - Am I in the right role, or is it the company which is making me feel this way ? whatever my headspace is on any random day, I know I am learning something everyday or atleast every month.

I am aligned to sourcing and procurement team which comes under Supply Chain & Operation (SCO) vertical. 
I have no experience in sourcing and procurement, which makes it an exciting opportunity for me to learn about even the basic structure and ways of working in the practice. 

A lot of work revolves around operating model transformation, responsible value chain and business solutions.
Basic approach of any consulting company is - To Assess the current state, identify gaps and opportunities to tap into and then recommend initiatives - prioritized in short-term and long-term lists.

The part where I feel uneasy is where I feel - no one knows what's they are doing - or rather why they are doing it, they just do it. It's impressive how they are still able to deliver on it (I guess). However, wouldn't it make more sense to ask more questions, do less projects but really think what is needed to be done?

or is this how the industry works? I need to check this with people in other companies. Till then, I wonder if consultants find the no-decision making positions liberating? cause real decision making is with the clients.

I have worked on one small-term (1 month) project along with a couple of actual BDs and few support tasks.
These projects gave me visibility into S2P practice, allowed me to network with people in my team and did equip me with confidence and experimentation into how I want to carry myself in my professional sphere. 

I recall this quote from a favourite TV show of mine - Madam Secretary "_When the world seems to be lacking in Integrity, you find it in yourself. You change the world right from where you are standing_". This has been my mantra till now.
