They told me that MBA is a protected environment, so experiment and try everything you want to - cause after that it will be real life. And I did exactly that. I opted for courses which were out of my comfort zone. I prioritised learning about people skills over academics (atleast I feel so).

I rolled into my MBA journey while still working with my previous company as the classes and other fun activities of the batch began. I felt like I didn't really had an off time before joining a full-time 2 year course and was short on deciding what I wanted from the 2 years of student life that lay ahead. I knew that during my time at MBA I will have time to think about my future (as few friends who had completed their MBA told me). First few months were about getting to know other 500+ students in the batch, preparing resumes and ourselves for the interviews. We started online (yes, covid) hence some classes felt exhausting - looking at screens for most part of the day after having looked at those same screens during the night for bonding exercises and/or projects. I liked getting to know people but online system seemed to come in my way. Going on campus in the middle of all this, meeting people we met online and preparing for summer internships - there was so much going on, all the time. It was stressful, sometimes felt meaningless but we kept going. It was our ambitions, our fear and our friends which kept us going. I know most of us could atleast name one person we depended on thorough it all. I know I can.

Term after placements felt less eventful. In-person classes began in december and were adjourned in January as Omnicron made its way in India. We cribbed about online classes, not being able to play, online fests and restricted entry/exits. I felt a sense of quiet, finally felt like I had the time to think and invest in my personal life. Choosing Financial Derivates as a course to study was the highlight of that semester. Only if we knew, this was the calm before the storm of what we called "Summer Internship". My summer internship experience was exhilirating, getting the opportunity to go to client's side, understanding their business, feeling the pressure to perform like I had never felt before. Out of the numerous advice that I received, one of them that I most vividly recall and think helped me through is this - "Keep a learning attitude". When my days felt extremely difficult and nothing was going right, I asked myself a series of questions - what am I learning? How will I learn? Who can help me learn what I am trying to do? What more can I learn?

As I received my Pre-Placement Offer from the company I interned with, I started thinking if I should sit for final placements? and if I want to or should, I will need to choose my subjects accordingly, will have to prepare accordingly. Some where along the way I decided to focus on other aspects of my life - both personal and professioanl. All my life, I had thought mainly on the professioanl side of my life. I wanted to pursue subjects I was interested in, without worrying if I will be able to score or not, or what impact it will have on my CGPA. I wanted to prioritised learning about the soft skills that leaders so often talk about in their speeches. And that I did. 

How slowly and quickly my second year went by. Priortising my health and leading an active lifestyle - I was playing badminton during internship. I started playing basketball as I went back to campus. Even after being active and e xercising for so long, I developed a severe lower back pain during my fourth term because of small jerk while playing badminton. I felt sorry for myself for not being able to even sit in class. After going through this twice and consultation with doctors, I discovered that it was because of severe Vitamin B12 and D deficiency. My body wasn't able to recover as quickly as it should have and the pain increased dramatically because of the deficiency. I always prided myself in knowing that I maintained a good diet, exercised - hence was living a healthy lifestyle. However, I missed one thing - because of covid, my exposure to sun was limited. Even while I was playing badminton during my online summer internship it was indoor. That made me realise how important it is to get my daily dose of sunshine. Health is important. I missed out on a lot because I wasn't well. Whatever I do, wherever I am busy, I cannot not look after my
