Recently I visited Nainital with my family. I have been there as a kid, but we needed a break from our mundane lives and didn't want to do something fancy. Hence there we were in the lake city of Uttarakhand, Nainital.

I was appreciating the government of Nainital for their measures to protect and preserve the integrity of the city. Policies like prohibiting fishing in the freshwater Naini Lake, installation of dustbins and public washrooms every 500 meters, and public appreciation of the sanitation and cleaning workers caught my eye as I toured the city with my family.

Then I came across the following article - https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-editorials/mussoorie-misery/

and it made me sad that being a tourist, I am contributing to the problems of the places I most heartedly adore. If it's beautiful, wouldn't I and like me others would want to witness the beauty? To feel it, and to get lost in it.
