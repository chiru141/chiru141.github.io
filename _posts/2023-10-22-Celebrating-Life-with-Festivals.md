title: "Can I bring the warmth of festivals closer?"

This Navratri, I had the chance to be in Gujarat (in my home state). I made the most of this opportunity and dressed up for most nights of Navratri and played Garba. I realized that I felt a similar energy during Ganesh Utsav a couple of weeks back. I know these are my favorite festivals, however, I also realized that I am generally excited about festivals and interested in their stories. These festivals bring change to our otherwise mundane lives, the vibrance brings people closer (hopefully) and makes us feel warm. 

I wish to create a space where I could arrange every festival that is celebrated in India, and provide that heart-warming experience to people. From food to decorations, from stories to various cultural rituals, and obviously the dressing up. Not an easy task though, Popular festivals we could still arrange but what about the other not-so-popular festivals and traditions? Also, the task would be to create an experience that is authentic and still add elements to make it relatable to the latest generation.

Before I figure out other pieces of the puzzle, I have decided to write about it.. and see if I can come up with something for each of the 365 days or at least 300 days of a year. 65 days could be for rest and play of the team. 

Need to start adding calendar, do I?
