Facing sustainability issues? Let's solve them using solar panels, e-vehicles, and power stations. How many times have we heard this? Are electronics really the answer to our woes?

What about the tonnes of e-waste being generated and dumped in land sites mostly in poor developing countries?
All the harmful chemicals that pose a threat to lives of living beings, life for that matter. There has been research with abundance of numbers available to tonnes of waste being generated. <Add research>

My search for this answer found a breakthrough during a conversation with a manager at Accenture Strategy working in the responsible value chain area. I presented to him my conundrum about e-waste generation and its harmfulness making it difficult for electronics to be a solution to our sustainability agenda. As he explained, it is reducing the dependence of non-renewable energy sources from the value chain basically abstracting the problem - so that any energy resource can be used to power our beloved automotives, and devices. this made sense.
