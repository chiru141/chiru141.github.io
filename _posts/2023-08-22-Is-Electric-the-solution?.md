"Facing sustainability issues? Let's solve them using solar panels, electric vehicles (EVs), and power stations." How many times have we heard this? 

Are electronics truly the solution to our environmental woes, or are we creating more problems in the name of sustainability?

Electric vehicles are touted as a cleaner alternative to traditional combustion engines, arenâ€™t they still reliant on power sourced from traditional fossil fuels? In many regions, coal and natural gas dominate electricity grids, meaning EVs indirectly contribute to carbon emissions. Factor in transmission losses, the energy-intensive process of mining semiconductor materials, and the e-waste generated at the end of a product's life cycle, and the equation becomes murkier.

E-waste is a growing global crisis. It is estimated that over 50 million tonnes of e-waste are generated annually, much of it ending up in landfills in developing countries. This waste often contains hazardous substances like lead, cadmium, and mercury, posing severe health and environmental risks. Despite efforts to improve recycling rates, only a fraction of this waste is effectively processed.

So, while we champion electronics as the heroes of sustainability, are we adequately addressing the darker side of this equation? 

During my search for clarity, I spoke with a manager at Accenture Strategy specializing in responsible value chains. I shared my concerns about e-waste and the seemingly unsustainable reliance on electronics. His response offered a new perspective: electronics are not the perfect solution, but they are a tool to abstract our dependence on non-renewable energy. By integrating renewable sources into the energy grid, we can reduce the carbon footprint of the value chain powering our devices and vehicles.

This perspective resonated with me. While electronics may not be a perfect solution, they play a critical role in the transition to a more sustainable future. The focus must be on improving recycling rates and integrating renewables into the energy grid. At the same time, exploring alternatives like hydrogen fuel and other innovative solutions is essential to achieving a balanced, sustainable energy ecosystem.
