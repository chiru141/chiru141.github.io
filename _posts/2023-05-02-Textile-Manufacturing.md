I am from Surat, Gujarat - The textile city of the Country. Growing up in the city, I remember seeing cloth (white cloth called grey) manufacturing from cotton threads, and embroidery machines. I have seen texturizing machines which adds to the strength of the threads. However, My understanding of the industry has gaps. Big gaps. With some time in my hand and my presence in the city, I am looking forward to understand the industry a bit more.

Recently, I visited a textile processing plant. The processing steps include treating the raw material and preparing it for printing. Fabric printing is done by three methods. One is a rolling mill which uses a roller to print repetitive designs on the cloth. Another looks like block printing. Digital printing has become popular for fabric printing, as it allows sophistication in design at a higher level. 

The plant is powered by coal as it is the cheapest form of fuel available. The plant was using mechanisms and processes to treat the air that they were releasing. I couldn't help but notice the patch of green farm lands that it was surrounded by. I am worried that fast fashion is leading to fast depletion of our habitat. I constantly live in this conundrum of economic progress through manufacturing and environmental sustainability. 

The amount of clothes we wear and discard that end up in landfills creating nuisance. Sure, there are ways nature regenerates itself, however, our rate of generating waste seems to much higher than the rate of decomposition.
