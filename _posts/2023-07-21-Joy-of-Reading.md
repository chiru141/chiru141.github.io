This "summer vacation" provided me with ample time to spend on reading lavishly. I finally picked up a book I was gifted by a friend over a year ago. "Kashmir - A tragedy of Errors" by Tavleen Singh became my first book on the political history of the country. I read Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility, A man called Ove by Fredrik Backman, and more.

Reading about Kashmir's history piqued my curiosity and led me to look out for and attempt other books on Indian Political History. I am currently reading _India After Gandhi by Ramachandra Guha_.  I don't recall being interested in the genre or reading something substantial apart from the history textbooks in school. However, Tavleen Singh's writing style and story about India's most volatile and beautiful "possession" kept me hooked. She has described the events in such detail through the lens of an eye-witness. The author's description was enough to make me feel the beauty of Kashmir from the confines of my room and to re-ignite the desire to visit the valley.
