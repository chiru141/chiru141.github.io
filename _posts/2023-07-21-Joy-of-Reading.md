This "summer vacation" provided me with ample of time to lavishly spend on reading. I finally picked up a book I was gifted by a friend more than a year ago. "Kashmir - A tragedy of errors" by Tavleen Singh became my first book on political history of the country. I read Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility, A man called Ove by Fredrik Backman and more.

Reading about Kashmir's history piqued my curiosity and led to me to look out for and attempt another books on Indian Political History. I am currently reading _India After Gandhi by Ramachandra Guha_.  I don't recall being interested in the genre or read something substanial apart from the history text books in school. However, Tavleen Singh's writing style and story about the India's most volatile and beautiful "possession" kept me hooked. She has described the events in such detail through the lens of an eye-witness.
