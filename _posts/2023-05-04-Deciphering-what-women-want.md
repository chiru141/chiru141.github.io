Every now and then, there is a reel, a post, a discussion that brings me back to the fight that women are fighting to feel heard, be respected and allowed to be successful. Some appeal, some demand and some advice. There are some who talk about the support they have received from their family, friends and lives. However, there are days when I feel every girl is fighting a battle, in one way or other. 

[My comments here might read like I am generalizing, but I am not. I wrote what I see and observe and question. I don't know the whole story and I don't claim to]

I am hating the fact that everyone around me potrays a woman as bechaari or abla naari. And women themselves. Every woman is fighting for her "rights". Are all the women really that repressed? Are all the women that sad and angry? What are they angry for? That their parents and husbands don't want them to take financial responsibility (to go out and work hard)? Isn't that the purpose of earning - to earn so much that one doesn't have to work another day?   Don't men feel the burden of financial responsibility on them? Sure, a woman is taught all her life to be satisfied with whatever her husband can provide. Even if it's less than what she could have provided herself. But men don't get the financial support they need from their wife. They don't get the choice between being at home and taking up financial responsibility. But don't men (husband or father in law) only stop women from supporting? Or may be that's only true for rich men who don't feel the need for women to take up financial responsibility. Are all husbands able to provide everything a woman desires? Is it only about money? Sharing the financial responsibility? Or working? Or is it about respect? And liberty to take one's own decisions? Fulfilling their own desires? Having their own identity? Is it that women want to show men that they could do what a men can, so they get the respect they deserve for preserving a family, for being a "home maker"? And in trying to be deserving of that respect that she so deeply desires, have taken even a greater challenge to prove herself like she always does? Putting in more effort than is required? Why are men so reluctant to give up control when they feel that a women's life is easy? By sharing the financial responsibility, aren't they who stand to win a lot? What is the reluctance about? Are they afraid of losing respect as they don't themselves respect what women have been doing for so many years? May be the fight is not about working or not working. Earning or not earning. May be men are scared that they will be treated the same way they have treated women if they lose control.

In the book "Sapiens", Author Yuval Noah Harari has a section dedicated to understanding the difference between a man and a woman. He has tried to reason why a man was thought superior to a woman. He has explained the possible reasons, events in history that might have led to the difference. He discusses that the difference between <> woman and 21st century woman (who is allowed voting rights, and driving license and more liberties) is a cultural one and not a biological one. Even though he himself questions his explanations, he has conceded that patriachial society has been a stable society to live in.
